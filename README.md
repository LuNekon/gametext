# gametext

That's just a personal "project", not realy one tho.

## ftg.py

This is just a basic text battle simulator between a random character and a random monster with random life points. You can attack, change your weapons, heal yourself and flee the battle.

## ftg.c and ftg.h

This is the same thing that ftg.py but not the same langage, not working because of pointers.
